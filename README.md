üìù About the Projects

This repository contains intermediate-level Python projects designed to strengthen your programming skills. Each project focuses on real-world applications while introducing new concepts like dictionaries, file handling, exception management, list comprehensions, modules, and more.

Unlike the beginner projects, these go a step further by involving:

‚úÖ Data management (Contact Book, Note Taking)

‚úÖ Error handling (Safe Calculator)

‚úÖ Data conversion and multiple return values (Temperature Converter)

‚úÖ Efficient filtering & comprehension (Student Grade Evaluator)

‚úÖ Randomization & security use cases (Random Password Generator)

These projects not only reinforce your Python fundamentals but also prepare you for building larger and more complex applications.

üìñ Project Details:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact Book

Description: A program that stores and manages contact details using dictionaries. Users can add, update, view, and delete contacts.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Demonstrates how to use dictionaries for data storage and retrieval, a core Python data structure.

Concepts used: dictionaries, accessing & modifying dictionary values, adding & removing entries

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ingredient Checker

Description: Checks whether required ingredients are available by comparing tuples and sets.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Teaches how sets help with membership testing and avoiding duplicates.

Concepts used: tuples, tuple operations, tuple unpacking, sets, set operations

3Ô∏è‚É£ Note Taking App

Description: A simple note-taking application where users can create, read, and append notes. Data is stored in external files.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Builds a foundation in file handling for persistent data storage.

Concepts used: file handling, reading from files, writing to files, appending data

4Ô∏è‚É£ Safe Calculator

Description: An enhanced calculator that handles errors gracefully. Prevents division by zero, invalid input, and uses custom exceptions.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Strengthens understanding of error handling and robustness in applications.

Concepts used: exception handling (try-except-else-finally), raising custom exceptions

5Ô∏è‚É£ Temperature Converter

Description: Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using functions that return multiple values.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Shows how functions can return multiple results and apply mathematical formulas.

Concepts used: defining functions, return values, returning multiple values, arithmetic operations

6Ô∏è‚É£ Student Grade Evaluator

Description: Stores and filters student grades using list comprehensions with conditions (e.g., passing vs failing).

Why it‚Äôs useful: Demonstrates the power of list comprehensions for clean and efficient filtering.

Concepts used: list comprehensions, conditional filtering

7Ô∏è‚É£ Random Password Generator

Description: Generates random passwords of desired length and complexity using Python‚Äôs built-in random module.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Introduces modules and randomization, essential for security and automation tasks.

Concepts used: importing modules, Python‚Äôs random module, randomization, string manipulation

8Ô∏è‚É£ Student Roll Number Generator (Alphabetical Order)

Description: Takes a list of student names, sorts them alphabetically, and assigns roll numbers based on the order.

Why it‚Äôs useful: Helps understand list operations, sorting, and assigning unique identifiers automatically.

Concepts used: list creation, user input, append(), sort(), enumerate(), loops
